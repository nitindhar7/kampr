The project is being tested on:

Contribute

Submit well documented code and I will merge your changes in
as long as your code does not break the build. For a list of some things that need
to be done visit [my pivotal tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/413087).
There's also [lighthouse](http://kampr.lighthouseapp.com/projects/87297/home).

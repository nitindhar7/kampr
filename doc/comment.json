Although I\nagree that an update would be beneficial.<\/p>\n<p>As far as the idea goes I don't see the relation between the\nfloppy disk and the die, however that could be because I don't know\nwhat your company is about. The floppy disk is quite outdated so\nyou might want to consider what that communicates, however if you\nwant to go ahead with the floppy disk idea, there are some things\nyou could do. First of all, had you not mentioned it, I would not\nhave realized that it was supposed to be a floppy disk, it's\nmissing that sliding thing on top which I believe would help\ncommunicate the idea of a floppy disk. Secondly you might want to\nconsider using a less harsh angle in the logo, or go full\nisometric. As it stands it doesn't feel very realistic, perspective\nwise. The circles for example are the same size, where as\nrealistically they would get smaller the further away they\nwere.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I'd think more about the concept and what I wanted to\ncommunicate and then the execution style.<\/p>\n\n",

For what\nit's worth, the floppy disk that the logo is based on is the\ngeneration before the 3-1\/2 inch \"floppies\" that you describe, that\nhad the metal slider to protect the physical media.

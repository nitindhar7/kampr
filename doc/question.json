As you all know I am hard at work on the first jsFiddle client for iOS - \"Fiddles\". \"Fiddles\" will be a universal app so it will be both an iPad app and a iPhone app but bundled in the same app. In about a week or two, I'm going to release it on TestFlight for private beta testing. Who would be interested in beta testing \"Fiddles\" for me? If you are interested please drop your email in the comments and I'll add you to the list and if you want to be notified of when \"Fiddles\" gets released on the app store, just let me know in your comment and I'll add you to the mailing list. Not sure about how much I want charge for \"Fiddles\".
